## My projects

I developed a large portion of Dark Cloud Enhanced Mod's features. These include: Using allies in overworld, sidequests, dungeon loot generating, some of the ultimate weapon abilities, quick-attribute switching, daily shop items, and the back-end for memory writing to PCSX2. A few examples of my (somewhat messy) code: [TownCharacter (main)](https://github.com/Gundorada-Workshop/DarkCloud-Enhanced/blob/master/Dark%20Cloud%20Improved%20Version/TownCharacter.cs), [SideQuestManager](https://github.com/Gundorada-Workshop/DarkCloud-Enhanced/blob/master/Dark%20Cloud%20Improved%20Version/SideQuestManager.cs), [CustomChests](https://github.com/Gundorada-Workshop/DarkCloud-Enhanced/blob/master/Dark%20Cloud%20Improved%20Version/CustomChests.cs)

Additionally I made a few smaller mods before Enhanced, including the Challenge Mod and a few randomizers.
